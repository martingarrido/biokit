This package is my personal wrapper for functions and utilities that I use repeatedly across projects and collaborations involving omics data analysis. Particularly, it makes use of the core functions from packages such as [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html),  [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) and [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) to automate processes as the statistical comparison and functional analysis of omics data.

## Installation

The package can be installed by running the `install_github()` function from [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) or [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html).

```
install_github(repo = "https://github.com/martingarridorc/biokit")
```
