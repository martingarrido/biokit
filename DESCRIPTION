Description: >
    Biokit is an unified wrapper package for functions and utilities to perform 
    the analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. It contains several functions
    to carry out a basic exploratory analysis of the omics data tables, together with
    tools to normalize and perform the differential analysis between the sample groups
    of interest. In addition, biokit can also conduct the functional analysis of the 
    results to reduce its dimensionality and increase its interpretability, using 
    over-representation analysis (ORA) or functional class scoring (FCS) approaches.
