Title: Toolkit for the automatic analysis of omics data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Martin Garrido-Rodriguez
Maintainer: Martin Garrido-Rodriguez<mgrcprof@gmail.com>
Description: This package is my personal wrapper for functions and utilities 
    that I use repeatedly across projects involving omics data analysis. 
    Particularly, it makes use of the core functions from packages such as limma, edgeR and 
    fgsea to automate processes as the statistical comparison and functional analysis of omics data.
